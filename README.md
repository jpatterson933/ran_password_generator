Final Draft of Random Password Generator

I want the display button for the user to start program
give the user a choice of 8-128 that they would input 

I want that input to be stored and it to determeine the lenght of the final result

I want the user to click the next button and for password character types to show on the next screen

give the user four checkboxes to choose password type

when one check box is clicked display very weak password
when two check boxes are clicked display weak password
when three check boxes are clicked display strong password
when four checkboxes are clicked siplay very strong password

I want a true value stored if the box is checked and a false value stored if the boxe is unchecked

I want those four values to determine the types of characters in the final result

after the user clicks next, I want to display the users randomly generated password using the five inputs
